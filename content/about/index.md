Hello ðŸ˜€, interestingly I got into Computer Science & Engineering for my BE and today I hold a Master's degree with the same from [Syracuse University](https://www.syracuse.edu) with 3.6 GPA .

- Currently, I am a Streaming Engineer(FullStack) at [talkshoplive](https://talkshop.live), where I contribute to building scalable web applications, focusing on optimizing live streaming with WebRTC, integrating RTMP Simulcast options for Instagram and Facebook, and improving real-time overlays using WebSockets. 

- Previously, I interned and worked full time at [Greif](https://www.greif.com). Additionally, at LexisNexis (HPCC Systems), I worked on automating GitHub Actions pipelines for deploying HPCC modules using Terraform, winning the Best Research category in a poster competition.

- Outside of work, I enjoy sharing my knowledge through blogs on [Medium](https://medium.com/@gagana.1128), covering topics related to software engineering, automation, and frontend frameworks.

I have been awarded as Performer of the month in NTT DATA.

Here is a list of the technologies that I'm familiar with!
